This is a simple batch timer script for timing an individual program. It also calculates the arithmetic mean real,user and sys times.
The timings are shown on standard output but also written to a file called "log-timings.txt" by default (modify the variable $LOG to change where the timings are written to).

To run at terminal

$ ./btimer <runs> <executable> [ <executable argment 1> ... <executable argment n> ]

Examples

$ ./btimer 5 /usr/bin/sleep 1  #Runs "/usr/bin/sleep 1" 5 times

$./btimer 3 helloworld #Runs "./helloworld" 3 times
